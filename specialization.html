                Renascia works with clients to assess their non-core or troubled business units and find buyers that will most value those assets. These creative carve-outs leverage our domain experience to  monetize rather than shutdown low performing businesses.

                With vast working knowledge of the international markets, Renascia is uniquely positioned to surface investment and partnership opportunities overseas. <br><br> Many Asian and European firms have developed specialized semiconductor technologies or applications that are ripe for a strategic exit.  China has an almost insatiable appetite for semiconductor investment.  Renascia has the contacts, both within the industry and in many cases, within the state agencies, ministries and councils, to discover opportunities and get them closed.
